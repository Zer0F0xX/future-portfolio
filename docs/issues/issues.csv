"Priority","Area","Page/State","Problem","Evidence","Fix Proposal","Effort","Impact"
"P0","UX","HomePage","Disjointed narrative from legacy UI","The `TimelineRail` and `IntroChips` components from the old design are still rendered, confusing the user about the primary navigation method.","Remove the `TimelineRail` and `IntroChips` components from `app/page.tsx` to unify the experience around the 3D Shard Orbit.","S","High"
"P0","A11y","Global","Keyboard navigation path is incomplete","Users can navigate the Shard Orbit but cannot easily activate a shard and then return focus from the project page back to the orbit.","Implement a focus trap or return-focus mechanism when closing a project view to resume orbit navigation.","M","High"
"P0","Perf","3D Scene","No fallback for devices without WebGL support","The application will show a blank screen or crash on older devices or browsers that lack WebGL, creating a broken experience.","Implement the `WebGLSupport` component that renders a pure CSS animated fallback if WebGL context creation fails.","M","High"
"P0","Content","Project Pages","`/about` and `/contact` pages are placeholders","The main navigation links to incomplete pages, appearing unprofessional and breaking the user journey.","Build out the content and layout for the `/about` and `/contact` pages using static content.","M","High"
"P0","Visuals","3D Scene","The central 'Hologram' is missing","The main visual anchor of the 'OS of You' concept is not present, leaving a hole in the center of the scene.","Integrate a placeholder GLB or a generative `HoloAvatar` component at the center of the `ShardOrbit`.","M","High"
"P0","SEO","Global","Default OG image is not present","When sharing the site, social platforms will fail to pull an image, resulting in a poor-looking link preview.","Create a default `og-default.png` (1200x630) and place it in the `/public` directory.","S","Medium"
"P0","A11y","Global","Focus ring contrast may be insufficient on bright backgrounds","The cyan focus ring might not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio if placed over a very light-colored element in the future.","Add a semi-transparent outline or a secondary, darker ring to ensure contrast in all scenarios.","S","Medium"
"P0","DevEx","Build","Bundle size is not automatically checked","The JS bundle could grow beyond the 180kb budget without developers noticing, leading to performance degradation.","Integrate the `check-bundle-size.mjs` script into the CI/CD pipeline to fail builds that exceed the budget.","S","Medium"
"P1","UX","3D Scene","Camera movement is static and lacks depth","The camera has a fixed position, making the 3D scene feel flat and less immersive.","Implement the `CameraRig` with damped pointer and tilt controls to add subtle parallax and responsiveness.","M","High"
"P1","Visuals","3D Scene","Post-processing effects are basic","The current Bloom and DoF are generic. The 'holographic' feel is not fully realized.","Implement a more advanced `Effects` stack with chromatic aberration and fine-tuned bloom parameters.","M","High"
"P1","UX","HomePage","No 'boot up' sequence on initial load","The site loads directly into the OS, missing a key narrative opportunity to set the futuristic tone.","Create a `BootSequence` component with a short, animated intro that then fades into the main OS view.","M","Medium"
"P1","Perf","3D Scene","Performance tiers are manually toggled only","The site defaults to a potentially heavy experience on a low-power device until the user finds the toggle.","Implement the `detectGpuTier` heuristic in the `PerformanceProvider` to automatically select a sensible default tier on load.","M","High"
"P1","Content","About Page","About page content is not structured","Content for the 'About' page would need to be hardcoded, making it difficult to update skills, bio, etc.","Create a `content/about.ts` file with a Zod schema for structured content (bio, skills, philosophy).","S","Medium"
"P1","A11y","3D Scene","3D interactions are silent","Users who are not looking directly at an element may miss hover/focus state changes.","Integrate a lightweight audio library and add subtle, spatialized sound effects for shard focus and activation.","M","Medium"
"P1","Mobile","Global","Target sizes for 3D objects are not guaranteed","On a dense mobile screen, it may be difficult for a user to accurately tap a single shard in the orbit.","Enforce a minimum angular size for shards in the 3D scene or increase their spacing on smaller viewports.","M","High"
"P2","Concept","Global","The experience is not personalized","The 'OS of You' is the same for every visitor, missing an opportunity to demonstrate adaptability.","Implement a simple entry modal that asks the user their industry and re-sorts or highlights relevant project shards.","L","High"
"P2","DevEx","Content","All content is stored in the Git repository","Updating a typo in a project requires a full redeployment of the application.","Migrate the `/content` directory loaders to a headless CMS like Sanity or Contentful.","L","Medium"
"P2","Visuals","Hologram","The hologram avatar is a static or placeholder model","The avatar is not dynamic or interactive, feeling less like a core part of a living OS.","Replace the static GLB with a generative, interactive particle-based hologram that reacts to user input.","L","High"
"P2","Perf","3D Scene","No non-WebGL fallback for core navigation","If the primary 3D scene fails to load, the user has no way to navigate the site's main pages.","Create a 2D/HTML version of the `ShardOrbit` that is displayed by the `WebGLSupport` component as a fallback.","M","High"
"P2","Content","Global","No section for thought-leadership or essays","The portfolio only showcases client work, not the individual's thinking and expertise.","Implement the `essays` content type, loader, and corresponding routes (`/essays` and `/essays/[slug]`).","M","Medium"
