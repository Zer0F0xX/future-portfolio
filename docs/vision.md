## Narrative Flow
1. **Arrival** – The grid inhales light as a silhouette forms. Caption: “Deploy your imagination.”
2. **Awakening** – Hologram breathes; orbit ports ignite. Voice: “Initializing digital footprint…”
3. **Exploration** – Orbit worlds: Work, Persona, Lab, Protocol, FixThis, Contact. Each with unique light/audioscape.
4. **Legacy** – Holographic dossiers drift into view; parallax blur trails as user scrolls.
5. **Contact** – World dims, hologram faces viewer. Voice: “Your turn to deploy.”
