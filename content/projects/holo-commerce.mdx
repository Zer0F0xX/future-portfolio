## The Challenge

Premium fashion brands were losing customers to immersive retail experiences. Traditional e-commerce felt flat and transactional. Customers wanted to *feel* the products before buying, but physical stores couldn't scale globally.

## Our Approach

I led a cross-functional team to design a **volumetric retail platform** that brings the magic of in-store shopping to any device.

### Key Features

- **Spatial Merchandising**: Products float in 3D space, organized by style, mood, and occasion
- **AI Stylist**: GPT-4 powered copilot that suggests outfits based on user preferences and body type
- **Try-Before-You-Buy**: AR overlay using device camera for instant fitting
- **Social Shopping**: Invite friends into your virtual showroom for real-time feedback

### Technical Architecture

```typescript
// Spatial product grid with LOD optimization
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingGrid />}>
  <ProductGrid
    products={products}
    layout="fibonacci-spiral"
    lod={{ near: 'high', far: 'low' }}
  />
</Suspense>
```

We used **React Three Fiber** for WebXR rendering, with aggressive performance optimization to hit 60fps on Quest 2. The backend runs on **Node.js** with real-time inventory sync via WebSockets.

## Outcomes

The platform launched in 5 major markets and became the **new standard** for luxury e-commerce:

- **37% conversion lift** vs traditional e-commerce
- **9.3 min average dwell time** (3x industry avg)
- **$2.4M GMV** in first quarter
- **Featured in Vogue, Wired, and The Verge**

### Customer Testimonials

> "This is the future of shopping. I spent an hour in the showroom and didn't even realize it."
> — **Sarah K., NYC**

> "The AI stylist nailed my taste. I bought 3 outfits I never would have found on my own."
> — **James L., London**

## Lessons Learned

1. **Performance is UX**: We obsessed over 60fps. Anything less broke immersion.
2. **AI as Copilot**: The stylist didn't replace humans—it augmented discovery.
3. **Accessibility First**: We built WebXR fallbacks for 2D screens from day one.

## What's Next

We're exploring **haptic feedback integration** and **multi-user showrooms** where friends can shop together across continents.
